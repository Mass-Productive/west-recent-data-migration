  "item_description": "<p>Dorma TS93 Series Cam Action Surface-Mounted Track Closer, Adjustable Size 5-6</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Seller States: Open box, but New </li>\n<li>Seller States: Retail over $500</li>\n<li>The Dorma TS93 Series represents the pinnacle of surface applied closers because of its unique cam and roller design. Doors equipped with the TS93 will open much easier than doors with rack and pinion closers with track arms. The TS93 is a closer with regular arm operating efficiency and track arm aesthetics.</li>\n<li>Door closer ANSI/BHMA Grade 1 certified.</li>\n<li>Unique cam and roller design</li>\n<li>Easy opening</li>\n<li>Possible push side installation</li>\n<li>Hydraulic backcheck</li>\n<li>Adjustable spring sizes</li>\n<li>Meets barrier-free requirements</li>\n<li>Features:\n<ul>\n<li>Push side installation</li>\n<li>When necessary, push side installation provides the benefits of track arm assemblies with the closer mounted to the door and the track mounted to the stop, creating a more tamper-resistant application.</li>\n<li>Adjustable Spring sizes for barrier-free requirements</li>\n<li>The Dorma TS9315 closer will be available with field adjustable spring power from size 1 to 5 for barrier-free requirements. The TS9356 will be adjustable from size 5 to 6 with 50% adjustment.</li>\n<li>Hydraulic backcheck</li>\n<li>The backcheck feature ensures the safe deceleration and restraint of a door which has been flung open or caught by a gust of wind. This effectively reduces the danger of the door and adjacent wall being damaged.</li>\n<li>Delayed action</li>\n<li>The delayed action feature retards the closing cycle between 120° and 70° (approximate values for pull-side door leaf fixing). The extra time allowed for passage through the doorway can be essential for people with luggage or bulky items: mothers with prams, personnel with tea trolleys, post trolleys, hospital beds, etc.; and also for disabled people.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>",
