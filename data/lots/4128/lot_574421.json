With the latest advancements in dbx’s proprietary AutoEQ™ and AFS™ algorithms, a new input delay module for delaying the FOH system to the backline.</p>\n<p>AUTOEQ™</p>\n<p>Improved AutoEQ algorithm ensures an extremely accurate, fast, and non-intrusive automatic EQ experience.</p>\n<p>With the RTA Mic “listening” to your room, the new, updated DriveRack PA2 AutoEQ algorithm sets speaker levels and room EQ automatically in a matter of seconds. This means room adjustments can now be made very quickly, without subjecting the audience to annoying, lengthy broadcasts of pink noise.</p>\n<p>ENHANCED AFS™ Feedback Elimination</p>\n<p>Enhanced AFS™ algorithm for faster, more precise feedback elimination, without adversely affecting your system’s tone.</p>\n<p>Nothing turns audiences away like annoying and potentially painful audio feedback. Fortunately, dbx engineers have revisited their already-stellar Advanced Feedback Suppression algorithm and made it work even better. The DriveRack PA2 listens for and anticipates feedback and adjusts speaker output automatically before it even has a chance, while never altering your sound.</p>\n<p>Wizard functions on the DriveRack PA guide you through easy, step-by-step processes to help you get the most from your loudspeaker system. Helps you easily configure level balancing, AutoEQ, Advanced Feedback Suppression, and provides access to built-in and constantly updating speaker tunings from most major speaker manufacturers.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<table border=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n<h4>AVAILABLE INPUT PROCESSING</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>dbx Compression</li>\n<li>AFS™ (Advanced Feedback Suppression)</li>\n<li>Graphic EQ</li>\n<li>8-Band Parametric EQ (adjusted when using the AutoEQ)</li>\n<li>Subharmonic Synthesis</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\">\n<h4>AVAILABLE OUTPUT PROCESSING</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Crossover (supports full range, 2-way, and 3-way systems)</li>\n<li>8-Band Parametric EQs (used for speaker tunings)</li>\n<li>dbx Limiting</li>\n<li>Driver Alignment Delays</li>\n</ul>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></p>",
