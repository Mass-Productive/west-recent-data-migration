A core system consists of a PCI card connected to a standard 19-inch, single-space, rack-mountable audio interface.</li>\n<li>The system includes AudioDeskTM, full-featured audio workstation software for Mac OS that supports both 16-bit and 24-bit recording at any standard sample rate up to 192 kHz.</li>\n<li>For Windows, a WDM driver is included for compatibility with audio applications that support standard multi-channel WDM and Wave drivers.</li>\n<li>Also included are Macintosh and Windows ASIO drivers for multi-channel operation with Steinberg Cubase and other ASIO-compatible software.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 17\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>The PCI-424 Card</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A PCI-424 core system ships with a single PCI audio card called the PCI-424. The card features a custom processor, a powerful DSP chip, four 6-pin Audio Wire connectors and an ADAT SYNC IN connector.</li>\n<li>High definition audio</li>\n<li>The PCI-424 system can operate at the following high sample rates: 44.1, 48, 88.2, 96, 176.4 and 192 kHz. All MOTU PCI-424 audio interfaces support rates up to 96 kHz. In addition, the HD192 interface offers analog recording and playback at 176.4 or 192 kHz.</li>\n<li>Audio Wire expansion</li>\n<li>The PCI-424 card provides four Audio Wire jacks, which are used to attach MOTU PCI audio interfaces to the card installed in the computer. Each Audio Wire is capable of transmitting 24 simultaneous channels of 96 kHz digital audio input and output or 12 simultaneous channels of 192 kHz input and output.</li>\n<li>Up to four MOTU PCI audio interfaces can be connected to a single PCI-424 card for a maximum of 96 possible input and output connections. All MOTUPCIaudiointerfaces(includingthe 2408mk3, 24I/O and HD192) can also be “mixed and matched” on the PCI-424 card, along with legacy PCI-324 interfaces, such as the 2408, 2408mII, 1296, 1224, 24i and 308.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Audio Wire carries a proprietary communication protocol between the card and the external I/O to handle the extremely low latencies required by the system. The heart of the PCI-424 card is a custom-programmed VLSI chip capable of simul- taneously processing all 96 inputs and outputs.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></p>",
