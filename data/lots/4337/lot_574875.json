It, therefore, could be subject to exhaust retrofit or accelerated turnover requirements to reduce emissions of air pollutants.” For more information, please visit the California Air Resources Board website at <a href=\"http://www.arb.ca.gov/dieseltruck\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">http://www.arb.ca.gov/dieseltruck</a>.” <strong>This vehicle may be reported as a Non-Compliant Vehicle, and you may not be able to register in California without meeting the CARB Truck and Bus Regulations.</strong> It is the buyer's responsibility to read and understand the ARB Multi-Regulation Summary Requirements for Diesel Truck Owners. Beginning January 1, 2020, the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) CANNOT register any vehicle that does not meet the requirements of the Truck and Bus Regulation.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong>  This item is being sold on behalf of an estate to clear off of the property. This item either had one of the following categories; 1) No identification was found on the frame, or 2). The ID or license plate found was verified with the California DMV where no record was found.
