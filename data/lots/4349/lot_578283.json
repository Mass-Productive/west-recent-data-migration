No assistance will be provided by West Auctions. Please bid accordingly. </span></p>\n<p>**<strong>Note:</strong> May not be able to register in California. This vehicle was previously a project car and is being sold on behalf of an estate. Per VIN record, DMV registration report lists this vehicle as diesel. However, upon inspection, it appears the diesel engine was replaced with a gas engine. A gas engine may require smog, whereas a diesel engine older than 1997 is exempt. Also note that the vehicle is planned non-operational registration deferred. Therefore, the Estate Seller sells this vehicle \"as-is\" in planned non-operational registration, non-running condition, with no smog performed by the Seller. The Buyer agrees to purchase the vehicle \"as-is\" and agrees to repair and smog the vehicle. An \"as-is\" no-smog bill of sale must be signed by both buyer/seller in an agreement to these stated terms. Buyer is fully responsible for all aspects of smog, repairs to smog if needed, transfer, registration, taxes, and fees due to DMV. Bidder will receive an application for replacement title and transfer form 1-2 weeks after removal. Please bid accordingly.</p>\n</div>",
