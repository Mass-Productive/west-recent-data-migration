## Collection Strategy: Weekly Chunking

### Why It Works

The West Auction API has pagination issues when using date filters. Our solution:

**7-Day Chunks Strategy:**
- Split entire date range into weekly 7-day periods
- Each period small enough to return all results in single request
- No pagination needed = no duplicates
- 100% collection efficiency achieved

### Results by Phase

| Phase | Items | Duration | Rate | Status |
|-------|-------|----------|------|--------|
| **Phase 1: Auctions** | 218 | < 1 min | ~53 weeks in 30s | âœ… |
| **Phase 2: Lots** | 31,124 | ~2 hours | ~4-5 lots/sec | âœ… |
| **Phase 3: Images** | 256,694 | ~7.7 hours | ~1.1 lots/sec | âœ… |

**Problem:** Some files missing  
**Solution:** Check logs, re-run specific phase

**Problem:** API rate limiting  
**Solution:** Scripts already handle this with delays

**Problem:** Disk space  
**Solution:** ~2 GB needed for metadata (images not downloaded)
